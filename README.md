# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Used Monte Carlo method to generate stock price paths based on jump-diffusion model
Used the simulator to forecast European option value. Discovered when iterate more than 10,000,000 times, the difference between simulated option price and the Black-Scholes price will be less than 2%. The convergence rate is not as good as Newton method
