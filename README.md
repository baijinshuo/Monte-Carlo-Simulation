# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Used Monte Carlo method to generate stock price paths based on jump-diffusion model.
Used the simulator to forecast option value. Discovered when iterate more than 10,000,000 times, the simulated result is quite close to Black-Scholes option value. The rate of convergence is not as good as the Newton method.
